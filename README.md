# Bumblebee Species Distribution Modeling and Population Monitoring

This repository contains species distribution models (SDMs) for several bumblebee species in Oregon, with a focus on Franklin’s bumblebee (*Bombus franklini*), one of the rarest and most critically endangered bee species in North America.

This project is a collaboration between **Lewis & Clark College** and the **U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)** in Oregon. All modeling and analysis were conducted using **R**, with map visualizations produced in **QGIS**.

## Contents
* __Species Distribution Models__
  SDMs were created using historical and future climate data, land cover, and occurrence records for multiple bumblebee species. These models help assess current and projected suitable   habitat, with a focus on the historical range of *Bombus franklini*.

* __Tutorials__
  Two tutorials included in this repository walk through the process of creating SDMs in R, covering data preparation, model building (using packages like maxnet), and visualizing     results in QGIS.

* __Mark-Recapture Pilot Study__
  In collaboration with the USFWS, we conducted a pilot mark-recapture survey on Mt. Ashland—historically the last known location of *Bombus franklini* (last observed in 2006). This study aimed to estimate local bumblebee populations and assess community composition. Results and methods from this pilot are also available in the repository.

### Purpose
This project aims to improve our understanding of habitat suitability and population trends for rare bumblebee species in the Pacific Northwest. The tools and models here may support future recovery planning and conservation action, especially for *Bombus franklini*.

### Tools & Software
* __R__ for data analysis and modeling
* __QGIS__ for map production and spatial visualization
